I’m a Data Scientist by training and a Research Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience. I currently work as a Research Scientist on ICMR’s PARAM project, a multi-modal longitudinal study, where I build data pipelines, standardize datasets, and improve data quality.

I’m eager to transition into a dedicated data science role, bringing expertise in ETL processes, pipeline development, large-scale data infrastructure, and hands-on ML coding and pipeline building.
